## Analyzing Employees at Hewlett Packard
In this assignment, I use my knowledge of SQL to analyze a set of given CSV files and,
1. Research and draw relationships between these tables by assigning primary and foreign keys as needed.
2. Use QuickDBD to visualize the relationships between these tables, creating a view that is easy to work from.
3. Import the CSVs into readable tables on PgAdmin.
4. Analyze these tables using SQL functions like JOINs, conditionals like WHERE, GROUP BYs, ORDER BYs, and occasionally wildcards like "%".

Of the given tables above, the drafted entity relationship diagram looks something like this,
